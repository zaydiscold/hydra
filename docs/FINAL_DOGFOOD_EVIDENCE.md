# Final Dogfood Evidence

The final Hydra dogfood pass needs packaged Electron and live-account evidence
that Codex cannot safely infer from source tests. Use the checked-in preflight
to create a redacted evidence artifact after you run the real app.

Current pre-dogfood performance evidence from 2026-05-26 is in
`docs/RELEASE_AUDIT.md`: dashboard metadata/status shaping is down 61.1% in
the local DB microbench, proxy retry body encoding is down 86.9% in the request
body benchmark, Vault status-total rendering is down 96.0% in the synthetic
5000-account benchmark, session refresher selected reads are down 13.4%, and the
rebuilt packaged macOS arm64 app sampled near-zero idle CPU after splash settle. The
five-minute packaged idle sample ended with Hydra main at 0.1% CPU and the GPU,
network, and renderer helpers at 0.0% CPU; a later current-source rebuild also
settled back to 0.0% CPU across all Hydra processes at the post-splash sample.
The icon-refresh rebuild packaged the regenerated macOS ICNS byte-for-byte and
also settled back to 0.0% CPU across all Hydra processes at `t+50s`.
A second icon-refresh relaunch repeated the same post-splash CPU result.

The full operator checklist is in `docs/PACKAGED_ELECTRON_DOGFOOD.md`. For the
current published release, derive the release version from `package.json`:

```bash
HYDRA_RELEASE_VERSION="$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
HYDRA_RELEASE_SLUG="${HYDRA_RELEASE_VERSION//./}"
DOGFOOD_DIR="$(mktemp -d "/private/tmp/hydra-v${HYDRA_RELEASE_SLUG}-manual.XXXXXX")"
gh release download "v$HYDRA_RELEASE_VERSION" --repo zaydiscold/hydra --dir "$DOGFOOD_DIR"
ditto -x -k "$DOGFOOD_DIR/Hydra-$HYDRA_RELEASE_VERSION-mac-arm64.zip" "$DOGFOOD_DIR/extracted-mac-arm64"
open -n "$DOGFOOD_DIR/extracted-mac-arm64/Hydra.app"
```

Run from the repo root after the packaged app pass:

```bash
npm run dogfood:final -- \
  --write-evidence="/private/tmp/hydra-final-dogfood-v$HYDRA_RELEASE_VERSION.json" \
  --version="$HYDRA_RELEASE_VERSION" \
  --artifact-dir="$DOGFOOD_DIR" \
  --app="$DOGFOOD_DIR/extracted-mac-arm64/Hydra.app" \
  --launch-diagnostics \
  --manual=packaged-gui-launch \
  --manual=window-controls \
  --manual=splash-unlock-dashboard \
  --manual=navigation-dead-buttons
```

Add the other manual flags only after you actually perform those checks:

- `--manual=touch-id`
- `--manual=live-account-flows`
- `--manual=screenshots-redacted`
- `--manual=windows-launch`

For a different release, substitute `--version=<version>`,
`--artifact-dir=<dir>`, and `--app=<path/to/Hydra.app>` with the downloaded
release artifact directory and extracted packaged app path.

Unknown `--manual=<id>` values are recorded in the evidence file and prevent `complete=true`. Treat that as a typo or stale runbook until corrected.

The default output is `docs/DOGFOOD_EVIDENCE.json` when `--write-evidence` is passed without a path. The example above uses an explicit path so the evidence location is unambiguous. `hydra audit` reads `docs/DOGFOOD_EVIDENCE.json` by default, or `HYDRA_DOGFOOD_EVIDENCE=/path/to/evidence.json` when you want to audit a downloaded or temporary evidence file.

The evidence records checklist status, artifact presence, `hydra audit` summary, Docker reachability, optional app-open status, and optional `--launch-diagnostics` results for the Electron runtime, LaunchServices, Finder AppleEvents, and Hydra's packaged app handoff. Use `--version=<semver>` when local package metadata lags the release under test, `--artifact-dir=<dir>` for downloaded GitHub release assets, and `--app=<path/to/Hydra.app>` for an extracted release app; by default the script uses local `package.json`, local `release/` artifacts, and `release/mac-arm64/Hydra.app`. It does not read the local database, cookies, screenshots, API keys, Clerk session IDs, local secrets, or account email contents.

Do not paste API keys, cookies, tokens, real account data, or private screenshots into this file. It is a status artifact, not a log dump.

This evidence file is not release-complete by itself. The release remains not complete while `hydra audit` has missing/blocker evidence or any required manual check is absent. Existing audit deferred items are expected before this file is written; `hydra audit` reads the completed evidence file afterward to clear the manual dogfood items.
